# Mental models - by Michael Simmons

One bit of advice: it is important to view knowledge as sort of a semantic tree -- make sure you understand the fundamental principles, ie the trunk and big branches, before you get into the leaves/details or there is nothing for them to hang on to.

[Research suggests](http://web.stanford.edu/group/WTO/cgi-bin/wp/wp-content/uploads/2014/pub_old/Hinds_Patterson_Pfeffer_2001.pdf) that turning your knowledge into deeper, abstract principles facilitates learning transfer. [Research](http://people.ucsc.edu/~gwells/Files/Courses_Folder/ED%20261%20Papers/How%20People%20Learn%20Ch3.pdf) also suggests that one technique is particularly powerful for helping people intuit underlying principles. This technique is called, “contrasting cases.”

Here’s how it works: Let’s say you want to deconstruct the letter “A” and understand the deeper principle of what makes an “A” an A. Let’s further say that you have two approaches you could use to do this:

Utilizing a decision tree does not require a PhD. All that’s needed is a basic understanding of probability. Here’s a step-by-step process you can follow to use the principles in your decision making:

- Understand the different outcomes that could happen (both positive and negative)
- Calculate the expected return or loss of each outcome:
- Attach a probability to each outcome
- Understanding the magnitude of the return or loss
- Multiple the probability by the magnitude (probability of winning * value of win) — (probability of losing * cost of the loss)
- Add up and subtract all of the expected returns and losses
