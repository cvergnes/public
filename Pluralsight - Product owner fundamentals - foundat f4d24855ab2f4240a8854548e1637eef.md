# Shifting to a Scrum mindset

75% of teams has adopted a Scrum or hybrid Scrum approach (among other agile methodologies) => survey Version One.

Common myths about agile

- Agile releases faster. No, they deliver sooner. Team may learn not all features planned are actually required. Team may see an initial drop at the beginning
- Agile and Scrum are the same things
- Agile methodologies are lightweight : but scrum trade light documentation over multiple ceremonies. For example, DSDM is heavy on doc and light on ceremonies.

Scrum is a framework not a process. A process (more related to manufacturing) is more prescriptive than a framework (more suited to volatile requirements on a software project).  Scrum define only boundaries and a cadence.

Empirical process control: projects are managed most successfully when their plans are based on observed conditions. So, SCRUM plans are based on what has occured not what should occur.

Empirical process control principles:

- Inspection : constantly reflecting on team progress
- Adaptation: altering plans to meet new devs
- Transparency: openly sharing information

Scrum framework values:

- commitment
- courage: tackle tough challenges, courage to say no to PO
- focus : focus only on the work of the team
- openness
- respect : interpersonal communication works well if only respect exist

Scrum is both incremental and iterative.

# Understanding the role of the PO

**Primary responsibility is to maximize the value of the product.**

Any member of the Scrum team could add items to the list **but** PO is responsible for the ordering of the list.

Most efficient Scrum teams are the ones which have few team members who have the right to create PBI.

3 principles of Product ownership:

- Product management : create and update vision and share it to the team, release strategy
- Business Analysis: identify requirements and update the product backlog accordingly
- Project management: project budget, project timetable is on track

Product Owner must be empowered to make decisions on behalf of the individuals they represent.

PO leadership: guiding the team and acting as the champion for your product to your organization.

**PO is always full time role (compare to Scrum master).**

**When individuals are overwhelmed they tend to focus exclusively on tasks they will be judged on**. Since many organizations, judge only on project being on time and in budget, PO overwhelmed will focus on project management responsibilities. So PO could focus on tasks which add few biz value.

**PO role has to be served by only one individual**. PO could delegate some responsibilities but should be accountable. Product vision should be owned by a single PO.

**Scrum master**:help the team to adhere to the rules of Scrum. Ensure teams operate efficiently. Facilitate ceremonies and protect the teams from disruptions. Remove any impediments.

**PO**: define and shares overall vision

Scrum master role is to mentor the entire team, including the PO.

PO:

- single source of knowledge for the product.
- define the product vision
- Ensure product backlog

In Scrum Framework, everyone who contributes to the development of the product is a developer.

**Cross functional dev teams**: operates more independently, reduce hands-off, …

**Preferred size** : 3-9, large enough to be self sufficient and not too large to coordinate. Research have found that 4 to 5 members is the optimal size.

No manager in Scrum teams. Teams are self organizing.

**Each role are considered to be equal.** But PO could considered as first among equals. PO must respect the team’s right to plan their own approach.

# Create a compelling product vision

Product vision help to understand the product goals so team could choose its own approach (and which tradeoffs to choose).

Great product vision communicates:

- What product will do ?
- Who is product for ? **Tightly focused products tend to have higher retention rate than broadly focused products**
- **Why the product will do it ? Help the team to be equipped to make decision on behalf PO and so don't wait to have PO’s answer.**

**Great product vision is:**

- **shared**
- **succinct (a 30 second elevator pitch)**
- **emergent (grows and evolves as more is learned about the product)**

Example of product vision board the one from roman pichler.

Plan to update the product vision regularly.

Product strategy:

- mature / evolving product : future features are well known or not
- market stability (emerging vs stable): nb of changes in recent years

Success product depend on where it fits in the market.

If evolving and emerging market, then product vision should be updated frequently.

# Pluralsight - Product ownership from the trenches

# Building the PB

PO is accountable that backlog is created and maintained.

How to prioritize product backlog:

- Business value,
- By risk (risky first)
- By technical necessity (items to be completed prior to each other)

In early phase of the development, you have often to prioritize first technical necessity items, then high risk items and then ultimately by biz value.

**20/30/50 rule**

- 20% of the backlog well enough prepared to be worked immediately
- 30% suitable for a productive discussion
- 50% only summary and possibly a description

**Last responsible moment: act of delaying a decision until the cost of not making a decision becomes greater than the cost of making a decision. Information: market research, other PBI implemented, user interview. Advantages: less attached to your incorrect decision, ..**

**Product backlog acronym DEEP : Detailed, Estimated, Emergent and Prioritized.**

**PBI three C’s : Card, Conversation and Confirmation.**

**Example of biz value scale: 1 incremental value to 3 market differentiator**

# Kick off the sprint

Sprint should be considered locked upon starting.

Choosing right length for your sprints: tradeoff between reactive to change and rate of focus. 2 weeks sprint is a good balance.

Cancel a sprint: only on critical situations (bad for team morale and organization).

Sprint planning:

- PO introduce the sprint objective and the items
- Team estimate
- PBI are moved to sprint backlog,
- Team create a plan to tackle each item (broken down in smaller tasks or at least most of them)

PO select **what** work will be planned but team choose **how much** will be planned.

### Estimation

Scrum framework do not specify how to estimate but several teams have found **estimate in complexity** very useful. Since most teams struggle with estimation duration, estimation in complexity seems a good proxy for duration. Use Fibonacci numbers.

Each item should have single estimate that encompass all work necessary to deliver that item.

PO could negotiate complexity but not implementation.

Planning poker: strong perso dominate less the discussion. Value follow Fibonacci sequence. Planning poker encourage all to participate. Estimate only done by the dev team. **Goal of estimation is to create a shared understanding of the work across the entire scrum team.**

### Sprint planning

- Provide a clear objective for the upcoming sprint
- Come prepared to discuss each item in detail
- Don't pressure team to reduce estimates

Instead of push to reduce estimates than try to reduce complexity.

**Estimates are a forecast, not a commitment.**

### Keeping the sprint on track

Daily scrum : timeboxed to 15 minutes, enhance planning at daily level, keep the team on the right track

Daily scrum is not a status meeting.

3 questions:  What did i do yesterday ? What will i do today ? What are the impediments to my progress ?

Daily scrum should focus on sprint goal.

Burndown chart:

- X axis represent working days
- Ideal slope of the progress

If progress is better than ideal than we should expect to add items to the current sprint.

On the contrary, il progress is worst, we have to prepare stakeholders to items will not delivered.

Burndown chart is an early warning system when team is to slip off-track.

# Looking ahead to the next sprint

### Backlog refinement

Each team should commit 10% of its time to refinine.

No specific format prescribed for how this practice should be performed.

- Have items ready for next sprint planning
- 1 hour per week for each participant
- involve only key members of the Scrum team
- **Scrum master is not required to participate (but schedule session each week)**

### *Blocking and tackling format*

1st grooming (blocking):

- PO: explain objective of the upcoming sprint and how each item contribute to that objective
- Team:
    - open questions and identify
    - technical blockers
    - take action for items unable to be resolved during session (for next refinement)
- block an ordered list of items to be considered for next sprint (based on velocity in complexity points of the previous sprint)

2nd grooming or tackling :

- consider each item in detail
- review acceptance criterias
- discuss supporting materials (wireframes for example)
- answer previously unanswered questions

A **spike**: a PBI intended to allow investigation into a future item for removing **risk**. A spike should have a **goal** and should be **timeboxed**. Spikes should be **scheduled one sprint ahead** of the related PBI.

### *Sprint review*

Elements of a sprint review:

- Validate: ensure team is on track to meet stakeholders needs
- Engaging: everyone in attendance is fully interactive
- Informative: resulting feedbacks informs about objectives of future sprints

PO should inform stakeholders on the type of feedback that would be the most beneficial to your team.

Sprint review preparation:

- make a list of which items you will review et who will review each item (a team member could review its own items)
- create an agenda (minimize switching between each reviewer). Tips: all presenters to share same computer
- send an email with the agenda to all stakeholders

Tips for getting the right people:

- stakeholders could lose interest if the content is irrelevant to them
- solution: sharing the agenda helps attends self select into the review
- PO should follow up with stakeholders whose feedback is particularly critical for your current work

No need to prepare sample data specific to the sprint review => objective is transparency

Objective of a Scrum team is not to deliver as much work as possible but be as predictable as possible. Usually velocity stabilize after 4 sprints.

Pattern yesterday weather best approximation of future velocity is based on velocity of previous sprint.

PO should avoid to commit to any action during the sprint review (due to a stakeholder feedback). He should have the time to consider the possible impact on the product backlog first.

PO should finally thanks all about feedbacks.

List of Scrum patterns: [https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/home](https://sites.google.com/a/scrumplop.org/published-patterns/home)

# Investigating in your team

### *Sprint retrospective*

Inspect itself and create a plan for improvements for the next sprint.

Sprint reto should be 90 minutes for a 2 week sprint.

Goals:

- inspect previous sprint
- identify what was well
- create a plan for improvement

Retro is for the whole Scrum team (including the PO).

# Planning for the long term

Multiple levels of planning and planning is ongoing

- Planning at release level: around 6 sprints. Encourage to think at a more strategic level
    - Think in themes (closely related items)
    - Agile release plan is an ongoing process
    - Defining release too far has a risk to over specify items (and before accurate information is available)

Release plan should define for each release a date only the month, themes, goals and kpi biz kpi

Release Burnup chart based on previous velocity and release date is the intersection between velocity and scope. Important velocity should always based on observed velocity.

Release strategies:

- FIXED scope, variable release
- FIXED date and variable scope

Preferred strategy is FIXED scope since it force to define the most important items to deliver.

PO hardest job is to know what to not add.

Release burndown chart and release plans are good communication tools.

# Plotting the PO career path

### Becoming a more productive PO

PO is not only responsible for describing every detail of the product.

Striking right balance:

- specify only the intent is not enough
- over-specify the details may team feeling constrained

DOR: criterias that must be met before Scrum team begin to work.

INVEST criteria

PO office hours:

- create regular schedule
- choose an area co located with the team
- bring work that can be done among others

### Scaling the Product ownership

Two strategies:

- scaling by themes
- split between strategic and tactical responsibility : backlog management (tactical) vs vision and strategy

Choose best scaling strategy depends on the product lifecycle:

- introduction
- growth stage
- maturity stage (no big investment)
- decline (no longer competitive)

Scaling PO useful mostly on growth and maturity phase : important to have only on PO in intro phase to have consistency.

### Scaling the product backlog

Multiple teams working on a single product must work on a single product backlog.

Standardizing points across teams usually fail because they will be drift in estimation. So, teams must regularly meet to confer regarding recent estimates.

# Defining your career path

Scrum masters progress usually toward agile coaching

Dev progress towards technical leadership

Many organization have designed advancement paths for POs :

- PO
- Lead PO : focus on strategic concerns (and should still hold some tactical responsibility)
- Chief Product owner: strategic and market analysis only

Certifications:

- CSPO by Scrum alliance
- PSPO 1 by Scrum.org
