## Udacity - intro to computer vision

Computer vision is about interpreting an image : who is there ? what's happening ?. Computational photography iis about capturing an image from a scene.   
OCR : Optical Character Recognition. Convert scannded docs to text.   
Face detection. Additional features : detect blinking and smiling  
Object recognition : 
Smart cars : recognize signs, pedestrians,   
Microsoft Kinect :  
Security and surveillance :    
Medical imaging :   

### images as functions
f(x, y) => intensity (for black and white photos)
If function is smothed, image is blurried  

Function is defined over a rectangle
f: [a, b] * [c, d] -> [min, max]

A color image is just three functions, one for red, one for green and one for blue (rgb). It could be written as a "vector-valued" function
