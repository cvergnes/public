### Solving linear sytems
A linear combination of x1, x2, ... xn has the form a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn
A linear equation has the form of a1x1 + a2x2 + ... + anxn = d where d is a constant. s1, s2, ..., sn is a solution (or satisfies) that equation
A system of linear equations is several equations with a tuple solution of all equations. 
Def : the first variable with a non zero coeff is the row's leading variable.
A system is in echelon form when each leading variable is to the right of the lrading variable in the row above it.
