# AI

## chap 1 intro
Since student in old science (physics for example) may think best ideas were discovered. In AI, frontiers are wide open.

### what is AI ?
Four approach. 

Acting as an human : Turing test (people can't tell it's an human or a computer who have responded to written questions). It requires NLP, reasoning, etc...)
AI researchers have devoted little effort to this test. They think it's more fruitful to study underlying mechanism of intelligences. Like aeronautics engineer who preferred studied aerodynamism than fool a pigeon with a fake pigeon.

Think humanly.   
To say that a program think humanly, we have first to know how humans think.
