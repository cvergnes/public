# Artificial intelligence modern approach

# AI

## chap 1 intro
Since student in old science (physics for example) may think best ideas were discovered. In AI, frontiers are wide open.

### what is AI ?
Four approach. 

#### Acting as an human : Turing test 
people can't tell it's an human or a computer who have responded to written questions). It requires NLP, reasoning, etc...
AI researchers have devoted little effort to this test. They think it's more fruitful to study underlying mechanism of intelligences. Like aeronautics engineer who preferred studied aerodynamism than fool a pigeon with a fake pigeon.

#### Think humanly.   
To say that a program think humanly, we have first to know how humans think. 
- introspection—trying to catch our own thoughts as they go by;
- psychological experiments—observing a person in action;
- brain imaging—observing the brain in action.  
Example : General Problem Solver was thought to mimic human thought
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field which could help. 

#### Thinking rationally
We should define the laws of thought. Easy for chess or arithmetic. Less easy for politics or warfare. In this case, theory of probability fill this gap. 
But it doesn't give any clue about the behaviour to be done
Logic requires knowledge of the world that is certain but us seldom achieved in reality 


#### Acting rationally: the rational agent approach
An agent is something that acts. A rational agent is expected to have the best outcome. 
This approach has several advantages : 
- more general 
- scientific development is easier : rationality is well defined mathematically and mimic human thought process perfectly is impossible

For this reason, this approach has prevailed since of the history of this field
So, this approach, agent which do the right thing bacame so pervasive that it's called **standard model**.   

Limited rationality when there isn't enough time to compute the optimal solution 

### beneficial machines
But in real life, objectives aren't always very clear. 
Example : for self driving car is go to destination in total safety but also shouldn't shake it's passengers, not hurting any pedestrians or other objects,...


Value alignment problem when objective put into the machine isn't the same than for humans
