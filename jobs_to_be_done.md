ℹ️ JTBD helps you understand why people use your product and/or features (i.e. jobs) and the outcomes they expect to achieve. Use this during innovation product management (i.e. zero-to-one or new verticals), as a tool to formalize customer feedback, and as an input to your story map.

ℹ️ **Pro Tip:** JTBD requires significant research and intuition about your users. Don’t try to do it all at once. Build your knowledge over time.
