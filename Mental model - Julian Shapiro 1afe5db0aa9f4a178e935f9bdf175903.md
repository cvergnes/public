# Mental model - Julian Shapiro

Jeff Bezos - **Regret Minimization** — To maximize your long-term happiness, prioritize projects you’d most regret not having pursued by the time you’re old and looking back at your life.

**Pareto Principle** — 80% of your output will come from the top 20% of your inputs. To maximize ROI, preferentially invest in the 20%.

For example, 80% of the value you get from socializing comes from the top 20% of your friends. So, preferentially strengthen relationships with those friends and drop many of the rest. Be cognizant of nourishing the friendships that actually matter.

Another example: 80% of your procrastination comes from 20% of your indulgences. So, place those 2-4 top indulgences out of arm’s reach, and you’ll see an outsized gain in weekly output. The implication is that you don’t have to completely isolate yourself from distractions. That would be inefficient and impractical. Just do the 80/20.
