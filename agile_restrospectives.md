# Livre : agile retrospectives d'Esther Derby

- Chapter 1: helping your team inspect and adapt
    
    Structure for a retrospective:
    
    - Set the stage, create an atmosphere people's are confortable: start with a welcome, appreciation for people investment of time, restate the purpose of the meeting and how long we meet, ask everyone to speak (one word or two), outline the approach, set the working agreements (everyone participate, cell phone on silent mode)
    - Gather datas: hard datas - meeting, d√©cision points, change in team memberships, metrics - velocity, burn down charts,
    - Generate insights:
    - Decide what to do. Don't do do nothing retrospective. Try to influence if the issue comes from outside the team
    - Close the retrospective: decide how to document and plan for follow-up
