# Coursera UX by Google

## Course 1 - Foundations of UX design

### Week 1 - Introducing user experience design
The phrase "user experience" was first coined in the 1990s, by cognitive psychologist, Don Norma   
Ux : how a person feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product  

Good UX :
- usable so including accessibility
- equitable
- enjoyable
- useful

Empathy : capacité à comprendre les sentiments ou les pensées de quelqu’un d’autre dans une situation

### Flavours of UX designers
- Interaction designers : focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. Try to understand the user flow. What should happen if a user taps on this button? How do we make this action easier for users to complete? And, how are the design elements within the website laid out? Focus on making product easy to navigate
- Visual designers : focus on how the product or technology looks, design logos, illustration, icons and decide font color, sire or layouts.
- Motion designers : think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product. How should an app transition between pages ? How do we show the connection between these actions? And, what’s an engaging animation that will help tell our story? Motion designers focus on design elements that move, rather than traditional static designs.
- VR/AR designers : Virtual reality involves a wearable headset that takes over a user’s vision; it blocks out their physical surroundings and immerses them in a completely virtual world.
- UX researchers conduct studies or interviews that examine how people use a product. UX researchers often identify pain points that users are experiencing and explore how products can help solve those problems. They also explore the usability of existing products, by asking users to complete tasks in an app or website, for example. 
UX researchers answer questions like: What problems are users facing? Is the design of this product easy to use? And, would people be interested in this new design feature? The goal of UX researchers is often to understand how a product can provide a solution to a real problem users are having.
- UX writers think about how to make the language within a product clearer so that the user experience is more intuitive. UX writers also help define a brand’s voice and personality
- Graphic designers : create visuals to tell a story or a message (focus on physical appearance) whereas Ux designers focus on how users interact with a product
- Production designers : marke sure first and final decisions match in finished product and assits for hand off to the engineering team
- UX engineers (dev) translate the design's intent into a functioning experience, like a website or an app
- UX program managers ensure clear and timely communication so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish
- Conversation designers develop the “persona” or personality of the voice, as well as the flow and dialog of the interaction.

### Product development lifecycle

#### Brainstorm
User research joue un grand rôle pour mieux connaître users.  
Objectif : générer des idées à propos de ses besoins. It’s important to pay attention to the diversity of your team at this stage. Teams that have meaningful diversity across identifiers like race, gender, abilities, family structure, age, and ethnicity are generally more effective at brainstorming because they bring together a lot of different lived experiences. 
Your team might already know the user problem that you want to solve when you begin the product development life cycle. If not, coming up with a list of user problems is a great place to start. 
The brainstorm stage is also an ideal time to check out your product's competitors and identify if there are already similar products available in the market. One more thing to keep in mind: A UX designer at a large company might not be very involved in the brainstorm stage. But a UX designer at a startup or small business could have a big role to play!

#### Define the problems you want to address
Who is the product for? What will the product do? And, what features need to be included for the product to be successful? 
During the define stage, your team narrows the focus of your idea. One product can’t solve every user problem. Continuing with the example for an app to help working parents and guardians, your idea should focus on helping parents and guardians find reliable childcare or manage their schedules, not both. 
UX designer might help the team pin down the focus of the idea, but a product lead will probably be the one to define the scope of the project.

#### Design
Develop ideas. 2 premieres étapes sont préparation et planning. Création de storyboard, wireframes ou prototype

#### Test
Focus sur les utilisateurs plus que sur le design. Interaction avec front end engineers pour créer un prototype qui fonctionne ou avec un outil comme figma ou Adobe xd. 3 phases de tests : internal tests within your company, reviews with stakeholders, and external tests with potential users. Ces tests sont réalisés par un researcher s’il y en a un
- First, the team **tests the product internally** to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is often referred to as alpha testing.
- Then, the product undergoes a **test with stakeholders** to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example.
- Finally, there’s an **external test with potential users**. This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred to as beta testing.
#### Launch for sharing a version

### Design for a good UX
Icons are usually better than text : it saves space, pleasing to look and easy too understand (quel que soit la langue de l’utilisateur). But if meaning is difficul, use text. Bad UX : add sth to your shopping cart and see it out out of stock when buying it.  

#### Characteristics of a good UX : 

- Usable : purpose of the product is clear and it’s easy to use
- Equitable : helpful for people with different abilities, background, gender, race. Example : emoji with different skin tones and genders
- Enjoyable
- Useful: ability to solve users problems

### Explore jobs in user experience
Prototype : early model of a product that demonstrates functionality
Information architecture : framework of a website, how it’s organized

- Cross functional teams
The product lead decides the scope of the project, the UX researcher tries to understand user trust, like whether users will trust the information about allergens or trust the app itself. The interaction designer figures out the flow for ordering, like how to include allergen-free foods in the search filter. The visual designer thinks about how to make it easy for users to find allergen-free foods in the product. These UX designers create wireframes and prototypes to show the experience that users will have in the app.

UX research is all about understanding what users need and expect from your product. UX researchers use methods like observations, interviews, and surveys to understand users' unique perspectives. Findings from research can inform your design decisions each step of the way. If you work at a startup or small business, there’s a good chance you’ll get to do your own UX research. At larger companies though, you’ll likely work with designated UX researchers who will provide research findings to inform your design work.

At some companies, product leads are known as product managers.

**Program managers** Program managers ensure clear and timely communication across the team, so that the process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish. Program managers supervise, support, and keep track of the project as a whole. They assign tasks to team members, monitor the project budget, and manage timelines, among other things. Think of your team’s program manager as your go-to source of support when facing any setbacks or issues with your work.

## Week 2 -  Define the user and user experience

### Definition
User : any person who uses a product
End user : specific audience a UX designer creates something for
User experience : how a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing a product
User-centered design : focusing on user’s problems / put user first and center

### Key frameworks in UX design
Frameworks : create the basic structure that focuses and supports the problem you’re trying to solve

#### five elements of UX design
- **Strategy:** The bottom layer is strategy, where you lay a foundation of your design goals. These goals are based on user needs and the business objectives for the product.
- **Scope:** The next layer is scope, where you determine the type of product you’re building. At this point, you will consider the kind of features and content you want to include in the product.
- **Structure:** The middle layer is structure. Here, you’ll figure out how to organize your design and how you want users to interact with the product.
- **Skeleton:** The skeleton is the layout of the product. Just like the layout of our bones shapes our skin, the skeleton layer details how your design works – and like a skeleton, users won’t directly see its inner-workings.
- **Surface:** The top layer, surface, represents how the product looks to the user. The surface represents the interface that users view and interact with. Think of the surface like the clothes or makeup you wear that are visible to the outside world.

#### design thinking
- During the **empathize** phase, the goal is to understand users’ needs and how users think and feel. This involves a lot of user research, such as conducting surveys, interviews, and observation sessions, so you can get a clear picture of who your users are and the challenges they are facing.
- In the **define** phase, you’ll create a clear problem statement, or a description of the user’s need that your designs will address, based on your research findings. This will drive your team toward a clear goal for the design of the product.
- Once you land on a user problem and establish why it’s an important one to solve, it’s time for the **ideate** phase. The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible.
- Once you have an idea of how to solve the problem, you’re ready to enter the **prototype** phase. A prototype is an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality.
- During the **test** phase, users provide feedback about your designs, before the product is built by engineers and launched to the public. You can use this feedback to make changes and improvements to your designs, as many times as you need.

#### User-centered design process
- **Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products** You want to know how users will engage with your design, as well as the environment or context in which they’ll experience the product. Understanding this requires a lot of research, like observing users in action and conducting interviews, which we’ll explore more later.
- **Specify the user’s needs** Based on your research, figure out which user problems are the most important to solve.
- **Design solutions to those user problems** Come up with lots of ideas for designs that can address the user problems you’ve identified. Then, start to actually design those ideas!
- **Evaluate the solutions you designed against the user’s needs** Ask yourself, “Does the design I created solve the user’s problem?” To answer this question, you should test the product you designed with real people and collect feedback.

#### Lean UX
- **Think.** Explore the problems that users are experiencing and consider how you could solve them with your design. This step is all about gathering research, so you can form a clear idea of who the product is for and how it will help them.
- **Make.** Start designing the product by creating sketches, wireframes, and prototypes. You’ll also create a minimum viable product, or MVP for short, which is a simple prototype of your designs that you can test with the target audience. Be prepared to go back and update your prototype as you gather feedback!
- **Check.** Find out how users respond to your design and gather feedback from project stakeholders. Make adjustments to your designs accordingly, and repeat the three steps again, if necessary.

There are six principles you should keep in mind when using the Lean UX process:

1. **Move forward.** Focus only on design elements and features that move the design process toward a particular goal. Don’t get distracted by “nice-to-haves.”
2. **Stay curious.** Lean UX is about using feedback from users and stakeholders to revise and improve your designs. Continuously seek feedback to understand why specific design choices work or don’t work.
3. **Test ideas in the real world.** Lean UX encourages designers to test their ideas - using prototypes, for example - outside of the conference room and with potential users.
4. **Externalize your ideas.** Instead of internally debating and analyzing whether or not an idea is going to work, turn your ideas into something physical, viewable, and testable, while they’re still fresh in your mind. This way, you’ll get feedback on your designs in the early stages, when diverse perspectives and feedback are most helpful.
5. **Reframe deliverables as outcomes.** Focus on creating usable, enjoyable products that users actually want and need. Always keep in mind that you’re designing for your users first-and-foremost, not for the project stakeholders.
6. **Embrace radical transparency.** Feel comfortable being honest with everyone on the team (and expect the same in return), since you will depend on each other’s insights. This way, everyone can make informed decisions about how to move forward and avoid wasting time and energy.

#### Double diamond
1. **Discover the problem** Gather information about potential issues users are facing.
2. **Define the problem.** Filter through the data, and focus on the main issue your product aims to solve.
3. **Develop solutions for the problem.** Begin designing your product as a work in progress. This is where wireframes and prototypes come into play.
4. **Deliver the product.** Review and test your product to prepare it for release.

There are four principles that inform the Double Diamond process:

1. **Focus on the user.** As is always the case in UX design, the user is the top priority.
2. **Communicate.** Communicate visually, through imagery and design choices that supplement the text. You should also be sure that the communication of your design is equitable and accessible, which you'll learn more about in this part of the program.
3. **Collaborate.** One of the unique features of the Double Diamond process is that it encourages creative collaboration and co-creation with your fellow team members.
4. **Iterate.** Accept that the design is a work in progress and isn’t going to be complete right away. The magic is in the revision. With every iteration, you give the user a new experience.

### Design across platforms

An average mobile session is 72 seconds. Desktop session is 150 seconds  

**The four Cs of designing for multiple platforms :**  
- **Consistency :** consistency across platforms and drive brand awareness
- **Continuity :** users can maintain their progress as they move from one platform to the next.
- **Context:** Considering that a user might check their email on a smartwatch as they sit in their car after they get home from work
- **Complementary** one way to create a great cross-platform user experience is to make sure that the design of each platform adds something new for the user

Example of cross platform experience : youtube, AirBnb, WebMD

### Universal design and equity focused design
Universal design (one size fits all) : one product for users with the widest range of abilities in the widest range of situations  
Inclusive design : design choices that take in account personal id like ability, race, eco status, gender, age, ...  
Equity-focused designs : design for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored  
Accessibility or (a11y) : design of products for people with disabilities   
a11y categories : motor; deaf or hard of hearing, cognitive, vision  
One billion people in earth has disability  
The term assistive technology, or AT for short, is used to describe any products, equipment, and systems that enhance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities

## Week 3 - design sprints

### What are design sprints ?
A design sprint is a time-bound process with five phases typically spread out over **five full, eight-hour days.** Design sprints generally include **five phases**: understand, ideate, decide, prototype, and test. Each phase last one day. 

1. Understand phase : learn from experts, conversations to understand users (users come first
2. Ideate phase : each team member try to draw ideas, try to schedule meeting with users for phase 5
3. Decide : with whole team app, design a blueprint for your prototype 
4. Prototype : 
5. Testing : users use the prototype

**Benefits of design sprints**
- Make sure focus on users
- Value every person in the room
- the best ideas will emerge
- Time to focus on design challenge
- Lower risks : validated by user
- Versatile scheduling

#### Plan design sprint & sprint brief
- user research is the first step in any sprint planning process
- call the experts
- find the right space : whiteboards, stick notes,
- gather supplies : markers
- establish sprint rules
- plan introductions : ice breakers (ask each team member to tell about a time they had to call a customer support : help to be put on users’shoes)
- post sprint planning : what’s next after sprint planning

Sprint brief : document to help all prepare for the sprint
Sprint leader : person who sends out the brief to the team

## Week 4 - UX design portfolios

### Portfolio

**A portfolio** is a collection of work that you've created that shows your skills in a certain area, like painting, photography, or UX design. **UX design is a creative field**, so it's important to show hiring managers examples of your work and demonstrate the skills you can bring to the job. **In the past**, portfolios were usually a physical collection of work like a giant briefcase full of drawings. But **in today's world**, it's more likely that your portfolio will be on a website, which is much easier to update and share.

**A personal brand** is how your personality, unique skills, and values intersect with your public persona. Your brand is the first impression you make! A personal brand should clearly demonstrate who you are as a designer and what makes you interesting.

## Understanding the role of research in design
Emiliy, senior UX researcher. Help engineers to empathize with users  

UX research : focus on understanding user behaviors, needs and motivations through observation and feedback. Your product design should be built upon research and facts, not assumptions.
UX research is part of product development cycle.

![user research](img/user_research.png)

### Foundational research
Foundational research is always done before you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens during the brainstorm stage (stage one)
what should we build ? what are user problems ? how can we solve them ? Am I aware of my own biases, and am I able to filter them as I do research?

There are lots of research methods for conducting foundational research, but many of them are based on observations. Common foundational research methods include:
- Interviews: A research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. You’ll often conduct interviews of your target users themselves.
- Surveys: An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.
- Focus groups: A small group of people whose reactions are studied. For example, your focus group might bring together eight users to discuss their perspectives about new features in your design. A focus group is usually run by a moderator who guides the group on a certain topic of conversation.
- Competitive audit: An overview of your competitors’ strengths and weaknesses. You'll conduct your own competitive audit later in the course, so you will understand this research method well!
- Field studies: Research activities that take place in the user's context or personal environment, rather than in an office or lab.
- Diary studies: A research method used to collect qualitative data about user behaviors, activities, and experiences over time. Often, a user will log, or diary, about their daily activities and provide information about their behaviors and needs, which can help inform your designs.

### Design research : how should we build it ?  
Design research is done while you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the needs of users, and to reduce risk. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed. 
The most common method used to conduct design research is a usability study, which is a technique to evaluate a product by testing it on users.
Additional research methods that might be used to conduct design research include:
- A/B testing: A research method that evaluates and compares two different aspects of a product to discover which of them is most effective. For example, you might have users evaluate two layouts for the homepage of your app to find out which layout is more effective.
- Cafe or guerrilla studies: A research method where user feedback is gathered by taking a design or prototype into the public domain and asking passersby for their thoughts. For example, you might sit in a local coffee shop and ask customers if they would be willing to test your app design for a couple of minutes and provide feedback.
- Card sorting: A research method that instructs study participants to sort individual labels written on notecards into categories that make sense to them. This type of research is largely used to figure out the information architecture of your project, which we’ll discuss in the next course of the program — Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Designs.
- Intercepts: A research method that gathers on-site feedback from users as they engage in the activities being researched. Intercepts are often conducted in the field, so this type of research is often considered a subset of field research. An intercept study can provide quick, high-level feedback.
User research could be done with only paper sketch or with a prototype

### Post launch research 
how we succeed ? 

UX researcher qualities : empathy, pragmatism and collaboration
Research methods you might use to conduct post-launch research include:
- A/B testing
- Usability studies
- Surveys
- Logs analysis: A research method used to evaluate recordings of users while they interact with your design, tools, etc. 

## Choose the right research method
**Primary research** : research you conduct yourself
**Secondary research** : use information someone else : books, articles or journals. It's done at the beginning, usually by PM   
**Quantitative research** focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. Quantitative research is often based on surveys of large groups of people using numerical answers.  
**Quality research** is based on interviews  (gives the why ?)  
**KPIs** for an app or new product launch might include things like how much time the user spent on a task or the number of clicks they used to make a purchase.  

**Secondary research** : 
example search study on user's behavior.
Advantages : it can save you time and money, back up your primary research 
Drawbacks : no feedback

**interviews**
**Interviews** are usually conducted in person and include a series of open-ended questions where the researcher asks the user about their experience.  
advantages : undestand wht users thinkn ask followup questions
drawbacks : take time and money, small sample size

(article about user interviews)[https://www.nngroup.com/articles/user-interviews/#:~:text=Topics%3A,of%20learning%20about%20that%20topic]

**surveys**
An activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product.  
advantages : large sample size, fast, inexpensive
drawbacks : no in-depth feedback

**usability study**
The goal of a **usability study** is to identify pain points that the user experiences with different prototypes, so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches  
Adv. : first hand user interaction, challenge our assumptions, in-depth feedback
Draw : only measure how easy a product is to use, expensive, diff between real life

Craig : user researcher.


## identify bias in ux research
**Def** : bias favoring or having prejudice against something based on limited information  
Choose your words carefully. While conducting research, it’s important to use words that don’t lead the user in one direction or another   
This is especially critical in usability studies. For example, imagine a participant is testing your designs. You ask the participant: “Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons?” Because you used the word “improved,” the user will most likely reply positively. But, this isn’t very useful feedback because you framed the question in a way that led the participant to respond accordingly. To improve your product, you need honest feedback.  
Instead, a better way to frame the same question is: “Explain how you feel about the layout of the buttons.” This phrasing allows the user to come to their own conclusions without any outside influence, which will give you better data about their thought process and experience.   
To combat the bandwagon effect, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.  
Limit the guidancee you give to users.

### confirmation bias
- ask open questions
- active listening
- include a large sample of users  
Confirmation bias is particularly prevalent in online surveys. For example, imagine that you’re conducting an online survey with a large group of participants. you provide four options with specifically worded language that the participant has to choose from. If none of the options you’ve provided apply to the user, they can’t select “other".

### false consensus bias
- identify and articulate your assumptions
- survey large group of peoples

### recency bias & primacy
most focus on more recent topic or more recent user
- take detailed notes
remember only first user

### implicit bias
sterotypes
- reflect on our behaviors
- ask other

### sunk cost fallacy
the deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course without feeling like we've failed or wasted time

[bias in user research](https://npr.design/overcoming-cognitive-bias-in-user-research-e4082f4506a)

One tool that can help you identify and explore your own implicit biases is the Implicit Association Test (IAT)
