# Continuous discovery habits by Teresa Torres

    
## Part 1 - What is continuous discovery ?

### Chapter 1 : The what and why of product discovery

#### Difference product discovery and delivery
            
Product discovery : decide what to build
Delivery : work to build and ship a product        
Most companies under invest in product discovery 
        
For many years, product discovery happened once a year in an annual budgeting process. Teams learned after delivery that users weren’t excited about the product they built. Marty Cagan called them : “Delivery teams”. This process produce a lot of waste. 
        
#### Product trio
            
        In 2001, Agile manifesto :
        
        - shorter cycles with more frequent customer feedbacks
        - working at a continuous pace
        - more flexibility to adapt to customer feedback
        - simplicity
        
        But discovery remains on the hand of leaders
        
        Solution : product trio - product manager, designers and software engineers
        
- Mindsets ?
        - Outcome oriented : success should be defined by value added not features delivered
        - Customer centric : add biz value
        - Collaborative : cross functional nature of product. Rather than product manager decides, designer designs and Dev codes, decisions are made by the team
        - Visual : do drawings and maps
        - Experimental : identify assumptions and gather evidences
        - Continuous : discovery is a continuous process
        
        Definition of product discovery: 
        
        > At a minimum, weekly touchpoints with customers by the team building the product where they conduct small research activities in pursuit of a desired outcome
        > 
        
Product teams make decisions every day. Our goal with continuous discovery is to infuse those daily decisions with as much customer input as possible
        
## Chapter 2 : a common framework for continuous discovery

- Not focusing on outcome (delivery) but in ...
            
            At many companies, tension between biz needs and customer needs. 
            
            Product trio should focus on creating **biz value and value for customers**
            
            Need to **shift from an output mindset to an outcome mindset**. Most product trios don’t have a lot of experience with driving outcomes. They grew up in a world where they were told what to build. Or they were asked to generate outputs, with little thought for what impact those outputs had.
            
        - Path to desired outcome need exploration of ....
            
            Finding the best path to your desired outcome is what researchers call an **“ill-structured problem”**—also commonly called a “wicked problem.” Ill-structured problems are defined by having many solutions. There are no right or wrong answers, only better or worse ones. Much of the work when tackling an ill-structured problem is framing the problem itself. But we can’t simply start with one framing. Instead, good problem-solvers try out many framings, exploring how each impacts the solution space.
            
            Customer needs, pain points, and desires are called “**opportunities”** not problems. **Opportunity space is infinite.** 
            
        - OST resolve ...
            
            
            - OST r**esolve tension between biz need and customer needs** → select only opportunities related to outcome
            - OST help to build a **shared understanding** : usually we stop to the first solution or we engage in fruitless opinion battles (which encourage to claim decision authority). Team takes time to **visualise options**
            - OST help adopt a **continuous** **mindset** : break down opportunities into smaller opportunities (that could be addressed in a 2 week sprint)
            - OST help do **better decision making by addressing common bad habits**
                - Avoid **“whether or not” decisions** by replacing to “which of these opportunity should we build ?”
                - Avoid **analysis paralysis by making reversible decisions**
            - OST unlock faster learning cycles: when a solution fails. Product trio should pause and think. Why they misunderstood user ? How it could improve other options ?
            - OST build confidence in knowing what to do next. Depth and breadth of opportunity space reflect teams’s current understanding
                - If opportunity space too shallow : more customer interview needed
                - If we aren’t considering enough solutions for our target opportunity, we can hold an ideation session
                - If we don’t have enough assumption tests in flight, we can ramp up our testing
            - OST unlock simpler stakeholder management : many teams share too much info (interview recordings, notes, ...) or too little

# Part 2 - Continuous discovery habits

## Chapter 3 : Focusing on outcomes
        - Biz metrics et ...
            
            PM souhaite améliorer rétention des utilisateurs à 90 jours. Mais il est difficile de constater une évolution rapidement. Et la rétention à 30 ou 5 jours est une KPI avec moins de valeur. Grâce aux interviews ils ont constaté que les clients n’étaient pas convaincu d’avoir de la nourriture pour chien personnalisé et certains chiens n’aimaient pas la nourriture : ce sont 2 meilleures metrics. Trouver une bonne metrics est un challenge. Il faut distinguer biz metrics comme le lagging indicator “retention à 90 jours” et les product metrics (sur lesquelles l’équipe a une influence). 
            
            - biz metrics, exemple : retention à 90 jours, market share, sales. Bcp sont des lagging indicators.
            - product metrics : mesure comment le produit mène la biz value
            - traction metrics : track des features spécifiques
            
            Assigning a team a leading indicator is always better than assigning a lagging indicator. Biz metrics are also often not in product team span of control. 
            
            Traction metrics useful only for junior product trios or for optimize an existing solution. Other, should focus in product metrics. 
            
        - On a new project first, a ... goal and the a ... goal
            
            Research suggests product trios performs better when they assign first a **learning** goal (eg discover new opportunities to drive engagement) and then a **performance** goal. We often need to do discovery to learn how to best measure a product outcome. 
            
        - 5 common anti patterns
            - Pursue too many outcomes at once
            - Ping ponging from one outcome to another
            - Setting individual outcome
            - Choosing an output as outcome. Example “launch an Android app” instead of “increase mobile engagement”
            - Focus on one outcome
    - Discovering opportunities

## Chapter 4 : visualizing what you know
            - Quel process suivre afin de connaitre notre point de départ ?
                
                Use case où un product trio essaie de rassembler chacun de son côté les éléments qu’il connait à propos d’un pb produit. Exemple : users ne vont pas au bout d’un process d’enregistrement. 
                
                Faire une map qui reflète ce que l’on sait de l’expérience utilisateur aujourd’hui. 
                
                - aide à visualiser toutes les perspectives
                - servira de guide lors des interviews utilisateurs
                
                Travailler individuellement pour éviter group thinking. 
                
                Dessiner ce que vous pensez de l’XP utilisateur. 
                
                Créer ensuite une map partagée :
                
                - chaque map est une collection de noeuds (un moment, une action, un évènement) et de liens
                - merger les maps
                - ajouter contexte : quelles sont les pensées, sentiments de l’utilisateur ?
            - 4 Anti patterns
                - débats sans fin
                - utilisez des mots au lieu de dessins
                - avancer comme si cette carte était la vérité. En réalité, il faut tester cette carte lors d’interview user
                - Oubliez que la carte doit être affinée de manière continue
## Chapter 5 : continuous interviewing
            - Do we have to ask sth to our users ?
                
                > “Some people say, “Give the customers what they want.” But that’s not my approach. Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do. I think Henry Ford once said, “If I’d asked customers what they wanted, they would have told me, ‘A faster horse!’” People don’t know what they want until you show it to them. That’s why I never rely on market research. Our task is to read things that are not yet on the page.
                — Steve Jobs, CEO of Apple, in Walter Isaacson’s Steve Jobs”
                > 
                
                **We are the inventors, not our customers. However, this doesn’t mean we shouldn’t be talking to our customers**. **The purpose of customer interviewing is not to ask your customers what you should build. Instead, the purpose of an interview is to discover and explore opportunities.**
                
                Apple is secretive about the way they work, so it’s not clear if they interviewed users, observed friends and family, or simply identified these opportunities based on their own experience.
                
            - What should we pay attention when asking users ?
                
                During a workshop, I asked a woman what factors she considered when buying a new pair of jeans. She didn’t hesitate to answer. She said, “Fit is my number-one factor.” I then asked her to tell me about the last time she bought a pair of jeans. She said, “I bought them on Amazon.” I asked, “How did you know they would fit?” She replied, “I didn’t, but they were a brand I liked, and they were on sale.
                What’s the difference between her two responses? Her first response tells me how she thinks she buys a pair of jeans. Her second response tells me how she actually bought a pair of jeans. This is a crucial difference. She thinks she buys a pair of jeans based on fit, but brand loyalty, the convenience of online shopping, and price (or getting a good deal) were more important when it came time to make a purchase.
                
                This story isn’t unique. I’ve asked people these same two questions countless times in workshops. The purchasing factors often vary, but there is always a gap between the first answer and the second. These participants aren’t lying. We just aren’t very good at understanding our own behavior.
                
                **Direct questions require that we recall facts without context**. This process is prone to cognitive biases—common patterns in mental errors that result from the way our brains process information. We are bad at quantifying how often we do something. We often speculate about what we did, when, and why. We tend to favor generalities over specifics. **We give answers that are influenced more by our sense of identity rather than our actual behavior**. And we tend to come up with coherent reasons to explain our behavior that are often not grounded in reality”.
                
                In fact, many of these biases come into play because our interview subjects are trying to be helpful.
                
                T**he reality is, our brains are exceptionally good at creating coherent (but not necessarily true) stories that deceive us**. Our brains simply fill in details that make the story coherent. You can’t simply ask your customers about their behavior and expect to get an accurate answer. Most will obligingly give you what sounds like a reasonable answer
                
                Too often in customer interviews, we ask direct questions. **We ask, “What criteria do you use when purchasing a pair of jeans?” Or we ask, “How often do you go to the gym?” But these types of questions invoke our ideal selves, and they encourage our brains to generate coherent but not necessarily reliable responses**
                
            - Research questions and interview questions
                
                The key to interviewing well is to distinguish what you are trying to learn (your research questions) from what you ask in the interview (your interview questions).
                
                Most product teams could generate an infinite list of research questions. There is always more to learn about our customers. We see some teams solve this by generating multi-page discussion guides. But this strategy assumes that you’ll be talking to customers only occasionally, therefore, you need to ask them everything right now. Instead, assume you’ll talk to customers every week, and focus on what you need to learn at this moment in time.
                
                Our primary research question in any interview should be: What needs, pain points, and desires matter most to this customer? 
                
                “Once we’ve explored the opportunities that matter most to the customer, we can dive into the specifics of any of those opportunities. You may have specific opportunities in mind, but you’ll want to let your participant set the direction of the interview. Remember, what matters most to your customer trumps what you need to learn. 
                
                Since we can’t ask our customers direct questions about their behavior, the best way to learn about their needs, pain points, and desires is to ask them to share specific stories about their experience. You’ll need to translate your research questions into interview questions that elicit these stories. Memories about recent instances are more reliable than our generalizations about our own behavior or our answers to direct questions.
                Instead of asking, “What criteria do you use when purchasing a pair of jeans?”—a direct question that encourages our participant to speculate. about their behavior—we want to ask, “Tell me about the last time you purchased a pair of jeans.” The story will help us uncover what criteria our participant used when purchasing a pair of jeans, but because the answer is situated in a specific instance (an actual time when they bought jeans), it will reflect their actual behavior, not their perceived behavior.
                
                For example, if you work at a streaming-entertainment company and you are trying to increase viewer engagement, you might ask, “Tell me about the last time you watched our streaming-entertainment service.” This question will help you learn about pain points and challenges with your product.
                
                Conversational norms set the expectation for a 50/50 back-and-forth pattern when two people are conversing. This means that each person spends roughly 50% of the time talking. I say something, and then you say something. If I ask you a short question, you are likely to respond with a short answer. As the interviewer, you need to reset this expectation. One of the most effective ways to do this is to inform your participant that you would like them to share their full story with you, to share as many details as possible, to leave nothing out, and that, when they are done with their story, you’ll ask for missing details.
                
                Temporal prompts are one of the most effective ways to guide the participant through their own story. You can ask, “Start at the beginning. What happened first? You can use the experience map you created in Chapter 4 to help guide your participant. Prompt for the beginning of the story. If your participant isn’t sure where to start, you can further prompt, “Where were you? Set the scene for me.” As the participant tells their story, you can encourage them to keep going by asking them, “What happened next?” Sometimes they might skip a few steps, and you may need to ask, “What happened before that?” Thinking about their story as having a beginning, a middle, and an end can help you guide the participant. Use your customer-experience map to help you track their story. Listen for specific nodes. Ask about nodes that were left out of the story.” What challenges did you encounter?” “How did you overcome that challenge?” “Did anyone help you? You’ll notice, as you excavate the story, that your participant will bounce back and forth between the story they are telling and generalizing about their behavior. You might ask, “What challenges did you face?” and they may respond with, “I usually…” or, “In general, I have this challenge…” You’ll want to gently guide them back to telling you about this specific instance. You might say, “In this specific example, did you face that challenge?” Keep the interview grounded in specific stories to ensure that you collect data about your participants’ actual behavior, not their perceived behavior. And remember, like most of the habits in this book, it takes practice. Don’t get discouraged. Keep at it. You will get better with time.
                
            - You Won’t Always Get What You Want
                
                With story-based interviewing, you won’t always collect the story that you want. That’s okay. The golden rule of interviewing is to let the participant talk about what they care about most. You can steer the conversation in two ways. First, you decide which type of story to collect. You can ask a more open question like: “Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment.” Or you can ask for a more specific story: “Tell me about the last time you watched streaming entertainment on a mobile device. In these instances, you’ll want to do the best you can to capture the value the participant is willing to share, but don’t force it. You always want to respect what the participant cares about most. Remember, with continuous interviewing, you’ll be interviewing another customer soon enough. When we rarely interview, a disappointing interview can feel painful. When we interview continuously, a disappointing interview is easily forgotten.
                
            - Synthesise as you go ****
                
                
                At the top of the snapshot, include a quote that represents a memorable moment from their story. An opportunity represents a need, a pain point, or a desire that was expressed during the interview. Be sure to represent opportunities as needs and not solutions. If the participant requests a specific feature or solution, ask about why they need that, and capture the opportunity (rather than the solution). A good way to do this is to ask, “If you had that feature, what would that do for you?” For example, if an interviewee says, “I wish I could just say the name of the movie I’m searching for,” that’s a feature request
                
                Throughout the interview, you might hear interesting insights that don’t represent needs, pain points, or desires. Perhaps the participant shares some unique behavior that you want to capture, but you aren’t sure yet what to do with this information. Capture these insights on your interview snapshot. Over time, insights often turn into opportunities”
                
                **Draw the Story you collect :** As you collect each customer’s unique story, you’ll want to actively listen for how their story is similar to or different from your generalized experience map. We’ll also see in the next chapter that drawing stories will help you find patterns across seemingly unique stories, which will be critical for making your body of research actionable
                
            - Interview every week
                
                 ****Weekly interviewing is foundational to a strong discovery practice. Interviewing helps us explore an ever-evolving opportunity space. Customer needs change. New products disrupt markets. Competitors change the landscape. As our products and services evolve, new needs, pain points, and desires arise. A digital product is never done, and the opportunity space is never finite or complete.
                
                > We recently had to pivot from one opportunity to another when we learned that the need we were exploring wasn’t that important to our customers. Fortunately, because we were continuously interviewing, we didn’t have to start from scratch. We could revisit our opportunity solution tree, choose a new opportunity, and start learning about it in our next set of interviews. We killed an opportunity on Tuesday, chose a new one on Wednesday, and used our already-scheduled interviews on Thursday to learn about the new opportunity
                > 
            - Automate the Recruiting Process
                - **Recruit Participants While They Are Using Your Product or Service:** The most common and easiest way to find interview participants is to recruit them while they are using your product or service. You can integrate a single question into the flow of your product: “Do you have 20 minutes to talk with us about your experience in exchange for $20?” Be sure to customize the copy to reflect the ask-and-offer that works best for your audience. If the visitor answers “Yes,” ask for their phone number. For new products or services with few or no customers, you can still implement this strategy. Instead of recruiting people while they use your product (as it may not exist yet), you can use ads to drive traffic to a landing page. You can recruit people directly from the landing page.
                - Ask Your Customer-Facing Colleagues to Recruit :
                
                The easiest place to start is to ask a customer-facing colleague if you can join one of their existing meetings. Start by asking for five minutes at the end of a call. You want to make it as easy as possible for both your colleague and your customer to say “Yes.” Use the last few minutes of an existing call to collect a specific story about the customer
                
                You can work with these teams to help you recruit interview participants. The easiest place to start is to ask a customer-facing colleague if you can join one of their existing meetings. Start by asking for five minutes at the end of a call. You want to make it as easy as possible for both your colleague and your customer to say “Yes.” Use the last few minutes of an existing call to collect a specific story about the customer.
                Once your customer-facing teams are comfortable with you joining their meetings, ask your customer-facing colleagues to help you schedule an interview with one of their customers. To make this work, you’ll want to define triggers to help your customer-facing colleagues identify who to reach out to. Triggers might include:
                - If a customer calls to cancel their subscription, schedule an interview.
                - If a customer has a question about feature x, schedule an interview.
                - If a customer requests a customization, schedule an interview.
                
                If your customers are particularly hard to reach : in these instances, setting up a customer-advisory board will help. 
                
            - Interview Together, Act Together
                
                Product trios should interview together. Some teams prefer to let one role, usually the product manager or the designer, be the “voice of the customer.” However, our goal as a product trio is to collaborate in a way that leverages everyone’s expertise. If one person is the “voice of the customer,” that role will trump every other role. Additionally, the more diverse your interviewing team, the more value you will get from each interview. What we hear in an interview will be influenced by our prior knowledge and experience. A product manager will hear things that an engineer might not pick up on, and vice versa. 
                
                Each perspective is valid and can lead to an important product improvement. The more diversity in the room, the more value you’ll get from each interview. And remember, an interview can be as short as five minutes. Everyone has time to spend a few minutes each week with a customer. And remember, an **interview can be as short as five minutes. Everyone has time to spend a few minutes each week with a customer**
                
            - Anti patterns
                - Ne pas s’appuyer sur une seule personne pour recruter des participants à interviewer. Que se passe-t-il s’il est absent ou qu’il parte ?
                - Poser questions : qui, quoi, pourquoi, comment and quand ⇒ trop de questions et datas non fiables. Au lieu de cela, générer une liste de research questions (ce que vous avez besoin de connaitre) et identifier une ou 2 story-based interview questions (que vous allez poser) : “Tell ma about a specific time when ...”
                - Interviewer seulement quand vous en avez besoin : il faut interviewer en permanence
                - Partager les recordings ou les notes ⇒ partager seulement vos conclusions
                - Arrêter de synthétiser. C’est une habitude continue. Il faut synthétiser à chaque fois

## Chapter 6 : mapping the opportunity space
            
            As you collect customers’ stories, you are going to hear about countless needs, pain points, and desires. Our customers’ stories are rife with gaps between what they expect and how the world works. **Each gap represents an opportunity** to serve your customer. However, it’s easy to get overwhelmed and not know where to start. Even if you worked tirelessly in addressing opportunity after opportunity for the rest of your career, you would never fully satisfy your customers’ desires. This is why digital products are never complete. How do we decide which opportunities are more important than others? But our job is not to address every customer opportunity. Our job is to address customer opportunities that drive our desired outcome. This is how we create value for our business while creating value for our customer. **Our goal should be to address the customer opportunities that will have the biggest impact on our outcome first**.
            
            Good thinking requires that we explore our options—that we carry out a systematic search for longer than we feel comfortable. We should compare and contrast the impact of addressing one opportunity against the impact of addressing another opportunity.
            
            - Maîtriser opportunité backlog
                
                The opportunity space is too complex to manage as a flat list. The parent-child relationship will be used to represent subsets—a child opportunity (or sub-opportunity) is a subset of a parent opportunity. Opportunités peuvent être même la même opportunité mais dans des contextes différents (exemple regarder film dans train ou dans avion). 
                
                Difficile de prioriser des opportunités de formes et de tailles différentes → f**orce de l’arbre** (parent-enfant et relation entre frère-soeur)
                
                
                Trees, it helps us deconstruct large, intractable problems into a series of smaller, more solvable problems. 
                
                As we dig in and learn more, we realize that different people solve this problem in different ways. Some people choose what to watch based on the type of show (e.g., they like dramas or crime shows). Others choose shows based on who is in it—they have favorite actors—and they use the cast list as their primary selection factor. The more we learn about how people evaluate shows today, the more likely we can turn a big, intractable problem like “Is this show any good?” into a series of more solvable problems: “What type of show is this?” “Who is in this show?” “Is this show similar to another show I’ve watched?” “Who else is watching this show?” and so on.
                
                Second, it allows us to deliver value over time.
                
            - Identifier des branches distinctes
                
                Noeuds de l’experience map peuvent se mapper sur les noeuds top level de votre OST. 
                
                If we continue with our streaming-entertainment case study, we might identify the - following distinct moments based on our experience map from Chapter 4:
                
                - Deciding to watch something
                - Choosing something to watch
                - Watching something
                - The end of the watching experience
                
                
                - Inventaire de l’espace d’opportunité
                    - Is this opportunity framed as a customer need, pain point, or desire and not a solution?
                    - Is this opportunity unique to this customer, or have we seen it in more than one interview?
                    - If we address this opportunity, will it drive our desired outcome?
                    
                    If the answer to all three of these questions is “Yes,” you’ll want to add it to your opportunity solution tree
                    
            - Anti patterns
                - Opportunités exprimés selon les désirs de la compagnie : If you had to add opportunities to support the structure of your tree, you might ask, “Can I imagine a customer saying this?” Or are we just wishing a customer would say this?
                - Parent with only one child
                - Opportunités pas assez spécifiques
                - Opportunités sont des solutions déguisées : easiest way to distinguish between an opportunity and a solution is to ask, “Is there more than one way to address this opportunity?
                - Capture feelings as opportunities : look for the cause of the feeling as an opportunity

## Chapter 7 : prioritize opportunities not solutions
            
            Our customers don’t care about the majority of our feature releases. Our customers care about solving their needs, pain points, and desires. Product strategy happens in the opportunity space.
            
            - Focus one opportunity at a time
                
                **Smaller opportunity** help to use iterative, incremental approach. If we spread ourselves too thin across many opportunities, we’ll find ourselves right back in the waterfall mindset of taking too long to deliver too much all at once. Focusing on one opportunity at a time allows the trio to explore multiple solutions , setting up good compare-and-contrast decisions. It’s also consistent with the kanban concept of limiting work in progress. 
                
                “Whether or not” question that leads to poor decisions. It makes us susceptible to confirmation bias, and we forget to consider opportunity cost. Instead, you’ll compare and contrast the set of parent opportunities against each other.
                
            - Assessing a set of opportunity
                - Opportunity sizing : How many customers are affected and how often? However, we don’t need to size each opportunity precisely. This can quickly turn into a never-ending data-gathering mission. Instead, we want to size a set of siblings against each other. You can use behavioral data (e.g., site analytics, sales-funnel analytics), support tickets, sample surveys, or even your interview snapshots
                - Market factors : evaluate how addressing each opportunity might affect our position in the market
                - Company factor : evaluate the strategic impact of each opportunity for our company, business group, or team. Each organizational context is unique. Google might choose to address an opportunity that Apple would never touch.
                - Customer factors : want to prioritize important opportunities where satisfaction with the current solution is low, over opportunities that are less important or where satisfaction with current opportunities is high.
                - 
            - Désordre
                
                Ne donner des notes a chaque opportunités. Trop compliqué. Il faut simplement comparer des opportunités de manière objective. Ok, s’il n’y q pas de vainqueur clair. Et attention aux notes ! Donne faux sentiment de vérité alors que rien n’est moins sûr que cette décision. Il faut être prêt à changer d’opportunité. 
                
            - Décision à double sens
                
                Compromis à faire entre data informed et analysis paralysis. Jeff Bezos a distingué entre décisions de niveau 1 (celle qui sont difficiles à renverser) et niveau 2 (celles qui sont faciles à changer). Niveau 1 doivent être prises avec lenteur et data informed. Et rapide et avec datas non parfaites pour décisions de niveau 2
                
                Explorer un opportunité (par du discovery) est une décision de type 2. Etudes ont montré que les personnes sont plus facilement critiques à propos de décisions de niveau 2. 
                
            - Anti patterns
                - Retarder une décision en attendant qu’il y ait plus de data. Pour l’éviter : time boxer la décision
                - focus sur 1 seul des facteurs
                - partir en arrière à partir de vos conclusions
    - Discovering solutions
 
## Chapter 8 : idéation suralimentée
            
            Identification d’un pain point, besoin ou désir déjà fait. 
            
            Les recherches ont montré que :
            
            - les premières idées sont souvent médiocres. Backlog sont souvent remplis de premières idées souvent médiocres
            - quantité d’idées et qualité / originalité sont corrélées
            
            Attention au brainstorming : personnes comptent sur les autres, conformisme, limitation par le membre le moins performant, illusion de la productivité de groupe
            
            Pour générer des idées: 
            
            - créer un channel dans Slack/Teams.
            - 1 fois que 15/20 idées ont été générées pour la même opportunité, c’est le moment d’évaluer.
            - Puis dot voting pour sélectionner une idée.
            
            Idéation est meilleur avec le plus de personnes possible (pas seulement le product trio).
            
            Anti patterns : 
            
            - Ne pas inclure diverses perspective. Solution : inclure le plus de personnes possible
            - Avoir des variations de la même idée : si pas assez idée, regarder ce qui est fait par d’autres produits d’industries différentes. Qui a déjà résolu ce problème ?
            - Limiter l’ideation à 1 session. Recherches ont montré qu’il faut du temps pour trouver des idées
            - Sélectionner des idées qui ne résolvent pas le pb. Brainstorming peut générer de bonnes idées mais qui résolvent un autre PB. Il faut les écarter.
 
## Chapter 9 : identifier des hypothèses cachées
            - Anecdote programme HLM
                
                Anecdote HLM construits à Portland pour famille défavorisés avec 1 ou 2 chambres (pour avoir plus de logements et donc plus de familles beneficiaires) alors que ce sont de grandes familles. Souvent 2 biais cognitifs : biais de confirmation (nous sommes attentifs qu’aux faits qui confirment notre opinion) et l’escalade d’engagement : plus nous investissons dans cette idée plus nous nous sentons engagé dans cette idée. Product teams sont particulièrement sensibles à ces 2 biais : ils ont souvent besoin de défendre leurs idées face aux stakeholders. Ils cherchent tellement a convaincre qu’ils oublient que leurs idées peuvent ne pas marcher. 
                
            - 2 solutions
                
                Pour éviter ces biais : compare and contrast opportunités (pour ne pas se sur engager sur 1), et utilisation de 3 idées par opportunités. Pour tester 10 à 12 idées par semaine, il ne faut ni créer des protos, ni créer des MVP mais tester des hypothèses- suppositions.
                
                Tester une hypothèse est plus rapide que tester une idée.
                
            - Types de suppositions
                - Suppositions sur la désirabilité : est-ce que les utilisateurs le veule ?
                - Suppositions sur la viabilité biz
                - Suppositions sur la faisabilité : faisabilité technique mais aussi en terme de compliance, légal, security, etc
                - Suppositions sur l’usability : vont-ils comprendre comment l’utiliser ? Est-ce accessible ?
                - Suppositions éthique : quelles données nous stockons ? Comment nous utilisons ces données ? Si utilisateurs avaient ces infos, seraient ils d’accord ?
            - Pour obtenir plus de clarté
                
                Après ideation, idées sont un peu vagues. Pour aligner product trios sur les idées, réalisation d’1 story map. Story map est généralement utilisé pour s’aligner sur requirements mais il peut également servir dans ce cas-là. 
                
                - Représenter ce que sera l’implementation de l’idee
                - Représenter les acteurs
                - Représenter ce que doivent faire les acteurs pour que tout le monde obtienne de la valeur
                - Séquencer les différentes étapes à travers le temps
                
                Chaque fois que vous ferez l’hypothèse qu’un utilisateur veut qq chose, vous faites un supposition de désirabilité, d’usabilité et de faisabilité. 
                
            - Autre façon de générer des suppositions
                
                Pre mortem : Imagine it’s six months in the future; your product or initiative launched, and it was a complete failure. What went wrong?”
                
            - Explorer pb éthique
                
                Utilisation des datas ? Application addicitive ?
                
            - Comment classer les suppositions ?
                
                
## Chapter 10 : tester des suppositions pas des idées
            
            Pas de test d’idée : uniquement des tests d’hypothèses
            
            - Exemple de test d’1 hypothèse
                
                exemple de test de l’hypothèse “des utilisateurs veulent voir du sport sur notre plate forme de streaming” 
                
                - proposer un mockup de Home page avec du sport et d’autres programmes à des users et voir qui clique sur le sport
                - proposer différents abonnements : celui qu’on veut tester et plusieurs compétiteurs. Leur dire que tous les abo stream le match et voir quel abo ils vont choisir pour voir le match.
            - Hypothèses peuvent être partagées entre idées
                
                Conséquence : plus rapide de tester des hypothèses que des solutions 
                
            - Hypothèses doivent être précises et numériques
                
                Par exemple : décrire le pourcentage minimum de personnes intéressées 
                
            - Echelle des tests d’hypothèses minimum
                
                Avant de tester à plus large échelle (A/B testing, survey, ...), nous voulons commencer petit, quelques users. Plus rapide et moins coûteux 
                
            - Echelle de test plus large
                
                Si hypothèse est toujours là plus risquée et compagnie ne veut pas prendre ce risque
                
                - smoke tests : lien vers offre futur dans la home page. Bouton Thumbs up / down et add comments.
            - False negative
                
                Faux négatif - Nos tests montrent que notre hypothèse est fausse alors que ce nest pas le cas : pb dans échantillon de personne choisit par exemple - pas grave nous avons d’autres idées
                
            - False postive
                
                Pas grave, cela sera repéré au test suivant à plus grande échelle
                
            - Unmoderated user testing
                
                Users font le test quand ils ont le temps. Le PM revoit ensuite la vidéo sur l’utilisation du proto
                
            - one question survey
                
                Question basé sur comportement passé. Exemple : “Please select all the sports you’ve watched in the past month.” ou “When was the last time you watched a sporting event?”
                
            - data mining
                
                search query with spots in it
                
            - common anti patterns
                - overly complex simulations - keep tests simple
                - test with not the best case - test with best audience should be done first


## Chapter 11 : measuring impact
            
            Anecdote expérience “aftercollege” ou plutôt que de demander à des étudiants le job qu’il cherche mais plutôt le job qu’il pourrait avoir en fonction de son diplôme. Pour tester l’hypothèse, ils ont routé une partie des étudiants sur la nouvelle page de search. Résultats : bcp moins d’abandon. Puis, ils ont attendu pour observer si les étudiants obtenaient bien un travail (biz outcome).
            
            - don’t measure anything
                
                Dont feature track everything. You will be overwhelmed and feature tracking could have bug. 
                
            - instead measure only ...
                - what is needed for validated assumptions
                    
                    For the “aftercollege” example, measure :
                    
                    - #people who visited search page
                    - #people who started a search
                    - #people who viewed at least one job
                    - #people who applied for a job
                    
                    count actions or count people ? If you need many people to take action, you’ll want to count people. If it doesn’t matter how many people take action, you’ll want to count actions.
                    
                    Other example : for relevance of search, they have tracked, the position of a job view in result search 
                    
                    - counting people : help to understand how many students having success on using the platform
                    - counting actions : help to understand how hard it’s for them to find success
                - what is needed to evaluate progress toward outcome
                    
                    Outcome at AfterCollege was to increase the number of students who found jobs on our platform. Mais le recrutement ne se fait pas sur la plateforme. Donc, comment connaitre le taux de recrutement ? Idée : envoyer un email 20 jours après la candidature pour proposer des conseils (négo salaire, intrview) pour connaitre le statut.
                    
                    Dans le cas de la plateforme de streaming, on peut mesurer 
                    
            - common anti patterns
                - mesurer tout. Au contraire, il faut mesurer pour évaluer les hypothèses et ensuite mesurer l’impact du produit sur l’outcome produit et sur l’outcome biz
                - se concentrer uniquement sur les validation d’hypothèse et ne pas penser aux biz outcome (la viabilité de notre entreprise en dépend)
                - oublier de tester la connection entre product outcome et biz outcome
 
## Chapter 12 : manager les cycles
            
            SimpleBusiness (startup spécialisé dans les small biz) : pain points principal des clients = paiements en retard. Multiples tests d’hypothèses ont montré que les users ne voulaient que quelqu’un intervienne entre leurs clients et eux.  
            
            CarMax : vendeur de voiture d’occasion avait identifié une opportunité pour mieux mettre en avant les voitures et notamment l’état de la carrosserie. Mais les tests d’hypothèses ont montré que seul une solution spécifique à chaque voiture serait utile. 
            
            Snagajob : marketplace pour travailleurs à l’heure. Ils ont offerts de devenir assistant de recrutement d’1 restaurant à coté de chez eux.  
            
            - Anti patterns
                - trop s’attacher à 1 opportunité
                - éviter les opportunités difficiles
                - tirer des conclusions d’apprentissages partiels
                
        - Chapter 13 : show your work
            - Starship use case
                
                Product team in Starship was missioned to create a customer journey builder (it's a marketing automation build tools company). But discovery learnt them that this solution isn’t perfect. They found a better solutionbut sales team pushed back. So, they propose a beta program with few customers to prove their solution is better. 
                
            - Meeting with Stakeholders, you shouldn’t be focused on solution
                
                Product trios too focused on outputs when meeting with customers (and meet often stakeholders expectations). 
                Everybody has a preference on output (opinion). So keeping discussion on solution space will encourage stakeholders to give their opinion. If they are more senior than you, their opinion will win (Hippo effect).
                
                “When we anchor the conversation in the solution space, we encourage our stakeholders to share their own preferences. However, these preferences aren’t always grounded in good discovery. After all, it’s our job to do discovery, not our stakeholders”
                
            - Meeting with stakeholders, show your ....
                
                Show your work on discovery 
                
                Show : 
                
                - your OST :
                    - start from your desired outcome at top (ask if it’s still relevant)
                    - share top level opportunities
                    - capture their opportunities suggestions
                    - share how you assessed or prioritized opportunity space
                    - share more context about your target opportunity : use your interview snapshots
                    - share the solutions you generated
                    - capture their solutions
                    
                    If you’ve already started assumption testing, share your story maps and your assumption lists. Make sure your stakeholders fully understand how each solution might work. Remember, this is where opinions and preferences might pop up again. Gently remind your stakeholders what your target opportunity is.
                    
                    Share the assumption map and all the data's. 
                    
                    Invite stakeholders to co create solution with product teams
                    
                    Even if you don’t like the idea (remember, our preferences don’t matter
                    
# Part 3 - develop your continuous discovery habits

## Chapter 14 - start small and iterate
        
        Anecdote sur première expérience pro : Actually, what that education gave me was the ability to bounce back. I knew that, while my boss (and the rest of the company) operated by throwing designs over the wall, it didn’t mean I had to. I got to choose how I did my own work, and I knew if I was going to be good at design, I needed to keep the client and the end-user close
        
        There is always a way to get closer to the customer. 
        
        Author shared that she had never support from senior mgt to do product discovery well
        
        Steps to iterate :
        
        - Find product trios. Don’t work alone
        - Start talking to customers : (keystone habits like do exercise or make your bed). To be clear, it’s not that exercise makes you eat better or making your bed makes you more disciplined, but doing the former makes the latter easier. The keystone habit builds motivation for the subsequent habits. When product teams engage with their customers week over week, they don’t just get the benefit of interviewing more often—they also start rapid prototyping and experimenting more often
        - Work backward
            
            When you are asked to deliver a specific solution, work backward.
            
            - Ask question : If we shipped this feature, what value would it create for our business?
            - Refine your answer until you get to a clear metric—that’s your outcome.
            - By the way, by asking those two questions, you’ve also built your first opportunity solution tree
            - During requirements building, create a story map of your ideas
            - Use story map to identify assumptions
            - As you implement the feature, be sure to instrument what you need to measure against the expected impact. Start doing post-release impact reviews with your stakeholders. Remind them what impact they expected a feature to have. Share with them the impact the feature actually had. If it falls short, as it inevitably will, share the implied opportunity you uncovered by asking, “Are we trying to solve this customer problem with this feature?” If your stakeholder agrees, ask if you can ideate with stakeholders
            
            The best time to advocate for discovery is when a feature falls short of expectations.
            
            - Use retrospective to ask questions :
                - What did we learn during this sprint that surprised us?” example : release with less impact than expected, new insight from customer interview, feasibility problem
                - For each item, ask question : How could have we learned that sooner ?
                - Faulty assumption we neglected to cover ?
                - If issue on feasibility : requirements misunderstood ?
