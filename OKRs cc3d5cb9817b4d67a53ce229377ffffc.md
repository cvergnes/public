# FAQ

- What are OKRs and how do they work?
    
    OKRs (Objectives and Key Results) are that thing that Google uses. You know, that thing that now every cool company uses to set and track goals.
    
    Your Objective is the destination you want to reach by the end of the quarter. And your Key Results are outcomes (not tasks!) you need to achieve to reach your destination.
    
    You want to focus on the really important things, so aim for no more than three to five OKRs per quarter, each with up to five Key Results. You shouldn't exceed 13 Key Results in total because a quarter only has 13 weeks and you're not Elon Musk. Plus, it's an unlucky number.
    
    Oh, and do stretch yourself! Setting ambitious goals is a proven way to push your boundaries. Hence, getting to 70% is actually usually considered a good result in the OKR way of thinking.
    
- How should I use this page?
    
    **Add an OKR:** 
    Click the template button "Add OKR." (It will be visible after duplicating this template.) Then move the template button below the newly created table to have it at the right place when you create another OKR.
    
    **Add a Key Results:** 
    Add a new row to the table, name your Key Result, and fill in the properties on the Key Result page. Properties include initial value, current value, target value, metric, and lead.
    
    **Update a Key Result:** 
    Just edit the property "Current Value" and progress in percentage will update automatically. On the Key Result page, you will see when it was last modified.
    
    **Comment on Key Results:** 
    Use comments to have conversations around progress made. Share the great things you did or what's in your way, ask questions, celebrate your coworkers' achievements.
    
    **Make it your own:** 
    Use the space around each OKR to add a link to the higher-level OKR you're supporting or to add some general information. Plus, there are tons of properties you may want to add to Key Results, like confidence levels, individual deadlines, or related tasks and projects.
    
- How is progress calculated on this page?
    
    Key Result progress is calculated based on initial, current, and target value. Initial and target values are hidden by default because you'll only edit them once a quarter or so. Open the Key Result page to define those values.
    
    Objective progress is what you see at the bottom of each OKR. It's calculated based on a crazy machine learning algorithm designed by the world's top data scientists. Oh wait, it's just the average progress of all Key Results.
