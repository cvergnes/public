# Intercom’s Storytelling Template

<aside>
ℹ️ *This template is a simple, effective way to communicate a customer problem you intend to solve and why. This should be no more than 1-page and easy to digest by all internal stakeholders. Inspired by [Intercom’s story template](https://s3.amazonaws.com/marketing.intercomcdn.com/assets/Intercom-Job-Story-template.pdf)*

# What problem are we solving and why?

*Describe the problem we’re solving, including why we’re solving it and any links to relevant customer discovery. This should be short and simple and help everyone understand the problem and how it impacts different parts of the organization.*

# Job Stories

*Add relevant job stories to demonstrate the value we plan to provide to customers and how it enables them. Use the format “When _____, I want to be able to _____, so I can _____.”*

# How will we measure success?

*Add both qualitative and quantitative metrics that will help us determine whether we have solved the problem or not. Use the S.M.A.R.T. goals when possible.*

# Scope

*Share high-level product development and design (i.e. what we’re building). Include release schedule with estimated dates.* 

# Anti-Goals

*Opportunity to be explicit about what we’re not building. This helps minimize scope screep up front and keep the team focused.*
